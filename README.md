# Operating-Systems
Coursework programs for Operating Systems course at the Cooper Union in the Fall of 2020. 

In addition to the problem sets, the programs were group assignments given the difficulty of the pandemic. In groups of 3, I worked with Philip Blumin, Paul Cucchiara, or Thodoris Kapouranis.
